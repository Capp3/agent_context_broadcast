# ST 2110 Bandwidth & Capacity Calculation Truth Report for engineering tools

**Document Purpose:** Define what can be calculated reliably from standards, what requires assumptions, and how to model uncertainty safely in SMPTE ST 2110 IP media networks.

**Edition:** May 2026 | **Audience:** engineering tools capacity planners and network engineers

## 1. Executive Summary

SMPTE ST 2110 transports video, audio, and ancillary data as separate, synchronized RTP essence streams over managed IP networks. Unlike SDI, which carries all essences in a single fixed-bandwidth signal, ST 2110 disaggregates the signal into independently routable flows — each with its own bandwidth footprint, traffic profile, and packetization behavior. This disaggregation introduces precision in capacity planning but also expands the number of variables that must be accounted for.[^1][^2]

**What is reliably calculable from standards:**

- Video (ST 2110-20) essence bandwidth using the VSF TR-05 Approximate Signal Bandwidth (ASB) formula, derived from SDP parameters and pgroup values in SMPTE ST 2110-20:2017[^3][^4]
- Audio (ST 2110-30/AES67) essence bandwidth using sample rate, bit depth, channel count, and packet time[^5]
- Transport overhead structure (IP + UDP + RTP headers = 40 bytes per packet; Layer 1 Ethernet overhead = 20 bytes per packet)[^6][^7]
- ST 2110-21 leaky bucket model parameters (CMAX and VRXFULL) for Narrow (N), Narrow-Linear (NL), and Wide (W) sender types[^8][^9]

**What requires engineering assumptions (must be labeled):**

- Aggregate link utilization headroom (no normative percentage defined in ST 2110 standards)
- Safety margins for traffic bursts and simultaneous flow activations
- Join-before-leave bandwidth double-counting during routing transitions
- Switch buffer adequacy for Wide (W) sender mixes

**What is implementation-dependent (must be marked Unverified unless provided by operator):**

- Actual packet size per sender implementation
- PTP management traffic contribution
- NMOS/IGMP control plane overhead per link
- Flow activation concurrency patterns

> **Note on VSF TR-05 Status:** The bandwidth formulas in VSF TR-05 Section 7 are explicitly marked **Informative** (not normative) in the document itself. They remain the primary engineering reference for ASB estimation, used by the industry and referenced by vendors, but they are not a "shall" mandate. This must be reflected in all outputs labeled "ASB."[^4]

## 3. Calculation Rules Catalog

### 3.1 ST 2110-20 Video Essence Bandwidth (Normative Source / Informative Formula)

**Source:** VSF TR-05:2018, Section 7.2.1 — "Approximate Signal Bandwidth (ASB)"; pgroup values from SMPTE ST 2110-20:2017, Section 6.2.4[^19][^4]

The ASB is calculated from SDP parameters using General Packing Mode (GPM):

\[
\text{packets_per_frame} = 1 + \text{INT}\left(\frac{width \times height}{\text{INT}\left(\frac{1426}{pgroupsize}\right) \times pgroupcoverage}\right)
\]

\[
\text{bits_per_packet} = 8 \times \text{INT}\left(\frac{1426}{pgroupsize}\right) \times pgroupsize + 94
\]

\[
ASB \; (Mbit/s) = \frac{\text{packets_per_frame} \times \text{bits_per_packet} \times exactframerate}{1{,}000{,}000}
\]

Where 94 bits = RTP and RTP extended payload header contribution per packet (derived from 12-byte RTP header + application-specific header bytes).[^6][^4]

**pgroup values (from ST 2110-20:2017, Table 4 / Section 6.2.4):**[^19]

| Sampling Format   | Bit Depth | pgroupsize (bytes) | pgroupcoverage (pixels) |
| ----------------- | --------- | ------------------ | ----------------------- |
| YCbCr-4:2:2       | 10-bit    | 5                  | 2                       |
| YCbCr-4:2:2       | 12-bit    | 3                  | 1                       |
| RGB / YCbCr-4:4:4 | 10-bit    | 15                 | 4                       |
| RGB / YCbCr-4:4:4 | 12-bit    | 9                  | 2                       |
| YCbCr-4:2:0       | 8-bit     | 3                  | 2                       |

**Subsampling factors for performance-level calculations (VSF TR-05, Table 1):**[^4]

| Sampling Format                    | Subsampling Factor |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| RGB, XYZ, YCbCr-4:4:4, ICtCp-4:4:4 | 3                  |
| YCbCr-4:2:2, ICtCp-4:2:2           | 2                  |
| YCbCr-4:2:0, ICtCp-4:2:0           | 1.5                |
| Key                                | 1                  |

**Worked Example (VSF TR-05:2018, Section 7.2.2):**[^4]

For 1080p59.94 (YCbCr-4:2:2, 10-bit, GPM):

- pgroupsize = 5, pgroupcoverage = 2
- packets_per_frame = 1 + INT((1920 × 1080) / (INT(1426/5) × 2)) = 3,638
- bits_per_packet = 8 × INT(1426/5) × 5 + 94 = 12,152
- ASB = (3,638 × 12,152 × 60000/1001) / 1,000,000 ≈ **2,650 Mbit/s**

**ST 2110-20 vs ST 2022-6 efficiency comparison (from AIMS/RAVENNA):** ST 2110-20 transports active pixels only, yielding approximately 30% bandwidth saving over ST 2022-6 SDI encapsulation for equivalent signals (e.g., 1080p50: ST 2022-6 = 3.074 Gbit/s vs ST 2110-20 = 2.143 Gbit/s).[^20][^21]

**Confidence: High** (formula is widely used industry reference; pgroup values are normative in ST 2110-20)

**Label: INFORMATIVE formula on NORMATIVE pgroup data**

### 3.2 Simplified Video Bandwidth Estimation Formula

**Source:** Vendor/industry implementation reference (Megapixel VR / CT Group) — **NOT a normative formula**. Provided for quick estimation only.[^22][^23]

\[
\text{Data Rate} = \text{Active Width} \times \text{Active Height} \times \text{Frame Rate} \times \frac{\text{Bits}}{\text{Color}} \times \text{Pixel Format Factor} \times (1 + \text{Packet Overhead})
\]

Where:

- Pixel Format Factor = 2 for YCbCr-4:2:2; = 3 for RGB or 4:4:4[^22]
- Packet overhead = typically 5–7% (implementation-dependent; not normatively specified)[^22]

**⚠ ASSUMPTION — LABELED:** The 5–7% overhead figure is a vendor-derived implementation estimate, not a normative value from any SMPTE standard. The ASB formula (Section 3.1) should be used for engineering-grade calculations.

**Confidence: Medium** (for quick estimation only)

---

### 3.3 ST 2110-30 Audio Essence Bandwidth

**Source:** SMPTE ST 2110-30:2017; AES67-2018; TVTechnology / AES67 Practical Guide analysis[^24][^5][^6]

Raw audio payload per second:
\[
\text{Audio Payload} \; (bytes/s) = f_s \times \frac{b}{8} \times N_c
\]

Where:

- \(f_s\) = sample rate (48,000 Hz mandatory minimum)[^12]
- \(b\) = bit depth (16 or 24 bits; both mandatory at Level A)[^25]
- \(N_c\) = number of channels per stream (1–8 at Level A; up to 64 at Level C)[^26]

**Example (ST 2110-30:2017 minimum interoperability — Level A):** 48 kHz, 24-bit stereo (2 channels): 48,000 × 3 × 2 = 288,000 bytes/s = **2.304 Mbit/s** raw audio payload.[^5]

**Packets per second** at 1 ms packet time (mandatory at Level A): 1,000 packets/second per stream.[^25]

**Per-packet audio payload size** (1 ms @ 48 kHz, 8ch, L24):
\[
1\,ms \times 48\,kHz \times 8 \times 3\,bytes = 1{,}152\,bytes/packet
\]

**Transport overhead added per packet:** IP (20 bytes) + UDP (8 bytes) + RTP (12 bytes) = 40 bytes. Ethernet Layer 2 header (14 bytes) + FCS (4 bytes) = 18 bytes; Layer 1 Preamble + SFD + IFG = 20 bytes.[^27][^7][^28][^6]

**Lawo reference bandwidth figures (informative, rounded):**[^29]

| Format           | Bandwidth  | Packets/sec |
| ---------------- | ---------- | ----------- |
| L16, 8ch, 48kHz  | ~7 Mbit/s  | ~1,500 pps  |
| L16, 16ch, 48kHz | ~14 Mbit/s | ~2,000 pps  |
| L24, 16ch, 48kHz | ~20 Mbit/s | ~2,000 pps  |
| L24, 32ch, 48kHz | ~53 Mbit/s | ~6,000 pps  |

These figures include RTP/UDP/IP overhead but may not include Layer 1 Ethernet framing overhead. Treat as estimates.

**Confidence: High** (core formula is derived from normative parameters in ST 2110-30 and AES67)

### 3.4 ST 2110-40 Ancillary Data Bandwidth

**Source:** SMPTE ST 2110-40:2018/2023; IETF RFC 8331; IP Showcase presentation[^13]

ST 2110-40 carries SMPTE ST 291-1 ANC data packets (VANC, captions, timecodes, AFD, etc.) wrapped in RTP per RFC 8331. The standard does not define a fixed bit rate — bandwidth is wholly dependent on the volume and frequency of ANC data packets in the source signal.[^13]

**Typical practical range:** 50–100 kbps per flow (from monitoring observations). However, this is a **non-normative observation** and may vary with the ANC payload types carried.[^30][^31]

**⚠ UNVERIFIED VALUE:** No normative floor or ceiling bandwidth for ST 2110-40 flows is defined in SMPTE standards. The 50–100 kbps figure is an engineering approximation only and must be verified per deployment.

**Confidence: Low** (bandwidth must be measured or estimated per specific ANC payload inventory)

---

### 3.5 Transport Encapsulation Overhead Breakdown

**Source:** IETF RFC 3550 (RTP); IEEE 802.3 (Ethernet)[^7][^28][^6]

The total on-wire overhead per ST 2110 packet can be decomposed as follows:

| Layer                      | Header Component                  | Bytes                   | Source           |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------- | ----------------------- | ---------------- |
| L5 (Application)           | RTP Header                        | 12                      | RFC 3550[^6]     |
| L4 (Transport)             | UDP Header                        | 8                       | RFC 768[^27]     |
| L3 (Network)               | IPv4 Header (no options)          | 20                      | RFC 791[^27]     |
| **L3+L4+L5 total**         | **IP/UDP/RTP**                    | **40**                  | [^6][^27]        |
| L2 (Data Link)             | Ethernet Header (DA+SA+EtherType) | 14                      | IEEE 802.3[^28]  |
| L2 (Data Link)             | VLAN Tag (802.1Q, if used)        | +4                      | IEEE 802.1Q[^28] |
| L2 (Data Link)             | FCS                               | 4                       | IEEE 802.3[^28]  |
| L1 (Physical)              | Preamble (7) + SFD (1) + IFG (12) | 20                      | IEEE 802.3[^7]   |
| **Total L1 wire overhead** | **All non-payload**               | **~78 bytes (no VLAN)** | —                |

The practical significance of L1 overhead depends on packet size. For a standard 1,500-byte MTU Ethernet frame, L1 overhead is approximately 1.3% of wire bandwidth. For smaller audio packets (e.g., 192-byte payload), the percentage overhead is substantially higher — up to ~24% at minimum packet sizes.[^7]

**⚠ ASSUMPTION:** ST 2110-20 video packets typically target ~1,500-byte MTU (jumbo frames may reduce overhead further). Audio packets at 1 ms/1ch/L16 are 32 bytes of payload, making overhead proportionally very large. Actual implementation packet sizes must be confirmed per sender.

### 3.6 ST 2110-21 Traffic Shaping — Leaky Bucket Parameters

**Source:** SMPTE ST 2110-21:2017; EBU/IP Showcase analysis[^32][^9][^8]

ST 2110-21 defines three sender types, each with normatively defined leaky bucket compliance parameters:[^11]

| Sender Type        | CMAX | VRXFULL | Typical Implementation                             | Burstiness                         |
| ------------------ | ---- | ------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Narrow (N)         | 4    | 8       | FPGA hardware senders; SDI-aware timing            | Low (SDI-like gaps during VBI)[^8] |
| Narrow-Linear (NL) | 4    | 8       | Hardware; evenly spaced across full frame period   | Lowest[^8]                         |
| Wide (W)           | 16   | 720     | Software-based senders (graphics generators, etc.) | High[^8][^33]                      |

**Definitions:**

- **CMAX**: Maximum instantaneous packet count allowed in the leaky bucket at any moment[^8]
- **VRXFULL**: Virtual Receiver Buffer capacity in packets; determines switch/receiver buffer sizing[^11]
- **TDRAIN**: Inter-packet drain interval = (TFRAME / NPACKETS) × (1/β)[^9]
- **β (Beta)**: Scaling factor in drain rate calculation (implementation-dependent; not normatively fixed)[^32]

**Compliance measurement:** CINST (instantaneous bucket occupancy) must never exceed CMAX. If CPEAK > CMAX, the sender is non-compliant.[^9]

**Critical design implication:** Wide (W) senders require significantly larger switch buffers than Narrow senders. A mixed environment with multiple simultaneous Wide senders can cause unpredictable buffer overflow if switch buffer depth is not sized for VRXFULL = 720 per concurrent Wide flow. This is a **normative requirement** from ST 2110-21.[^20][^32]

---

### 3.7 ST 2022-7 Redundancy Bandwidth Multiplier

**Source:** SMPTE ST 2022-7; Clearcom / RIST documentation[^14][^34]

ST 2022-7 provides seamless protection switching by transmitting two identical, independent copies of each RTP stream over separate network paths (commonly called Red and Blue). The receiver buffers both and reconstructs a single output using RTP sequence numbers.[^35][^14]

**Bandwidth implication:** Each flow protected by ST 2022-7 consumes **double** the bandwidth — once on each network path. Aggregate link budgets must apply a multiplier of 2× for all ST 2022-7-protected flows.[^22]

**⚠ ASSUMPTION — LABELED:** In a dual-network (n+n) topology, each physical network must be capable of carrying the full load independently. In a single-network ST 2022-7 implementation (requiring SDN path disjointness per IS-06), total network capacity must accommodate both streams simultaneously.[^36][^37]

---

## 4. Required Inputs for engineering tools

## 5. Derived Outputs and Reporting Requirements

### 5.1 Per-Essence Bandwidth Output

For each defined essence flow, Engineering tools should output:

- **ASB (Mbit/s):** Calculated using VSF TR-05 formula; labeled as Informative[^4]
- **Packets per second:** Derived from packets_per_frame × frame_rate (video) or 1/packet_time (audio)
- **Transport overhead add-on:** IP/UDP/RTP = 40 bytes per packet; L2 = 18 bytes; L1 = 20 bytes[^6][^7]
- **Wire-rate bandwidth:** ASB adjusted for total header overhead
- **Sender type declared:** N, NL, or W — affects switch buffer requirement[^8]

### 5.2 Aggregate Link Budget Output

For each monitored link:

- **Sum of active ingress flows × bandwidth per flow:** This is the active bandwidth load
- **Comparison against physical link capacity**
- **Utilization percentage:** (Active bandwidth / Link capacity) × 100
- **Available headroom:** Link capacity − active bandwidth − management/control traffic reserve

### 5.3 ST 2022-7 Adjusted Output

Where ST 2022-7 is active, all flow bandwidths must be reported as doubled, and the report must clearly indicate which paths carry the redundant copies.[^36][^22]

### 5.4 Snapshot vs Time-Window Reporting

The ST 2110 standard does not define a reporting window. However, IS-04/IS-05 maintain version-stamped state of active connections. Engineering tools should:[^17]

- **Snapshot report:** Capture current active flow state at a point in time via IS-04 query
- **Time-window report:** Track flow activations and deactivations over a period; report peak concurrent bandwidth
- Distinguish between **staged** (IS-05 staged but not activated) and **active** (IS-05 activated) flows[^17]
- Report ingress and egress separately per switch port; these can differ where multicast replication occurs[^40]

---

## 6. Link-Level and Switch-Level Modeling Guidance

### 6.1 Link-Level Capacity Model

A link budget must account for all active multicast flows traversing that link, not just the flows originating from or terminating at connected devices. In a spine-leaf topology, uplink links may carry aggregated traffic from multiple leaf-connected devices simultaneously.[^37][^41]

**Non-blocking condition (AIMS Alliance guidance):**[^41]

> "The bandwidth of an uplink trunk from a router, connected to a second router (analogous to Leaf and Spine) must be equal to, or greater than, the total bandwidth which could be routed to it by the network tributaries feeding the router generating the uplink."

This is an **engineering guidance statement** (not a normative standard), but it represents the accepted design target for non-blocking media networks.

**Link utilization targets:** No normative ceiling is defined in ST 2110 standards. Engineering convention typically targets 40–50% utilization for media-critical links to provide headroom for burst traffic, simultaneous routing changes, and Wide sender traffic spikes. This is an **ASSUMPTION** and must be confirmed against organizational policy.[^42][^37]

### 6.2 Switch-Level Capacity Model

Switches must be sized for:

1. **Total forwarding bandwidth:** Sum of all simultaneously active multicast streams passing through the switch fabric
2. **Packet buffer depth per port:** Must accommodate VRXFULL = 720 packets for Wide senders; VRXFULL = 8 for Narrow/NL senders[^8]
3. **Multicast replication capacity:** One ingress multicast flow may be replicated to N egress ports; internal switching fabric must support this without head-of-line blocking[^40][^41]
4. **IGMP snooping table size:** Must accommodate all multicast group memberships; overflow causes flooding[^40]

**IS-06 (AMWA Network Control) role:** IS-06 enables a Network Controller to receive bandwidth reservation requests from a Broadcast Controller, enforce per-flow bandwidth limits, and provide feedback on link capacity availability. Where IS-06 is deployed, bandwidth reservation is software-enforced. Where it is not, capacity planning is purely manual and subject to misconfiguration risk.[^43][^18]

### 6.3 Connected Device Count vs Flow Count

The number of physical devices connected to a switch does not directly determine bandwidth load. A single device may originate multiple simultaneous flows (e.g., one 1080p59.94 video flow + multiple 8-channel audio flows + one ANC flow). Conversely, a device may be subscribed to many inbound flows simultaneously. Engineering tools must model at the **flow level**, not the device level, and must know:

- Number of active sender flows per device
- Number of active receiver subscriptions per device
- Whether the device is multicast source or subscriber (affects which links carry traffic)[^44][^1]

---

## 7. Validation Checklist for Capacity Planning

The following checks must pass before a capacity planning report is considered valid.

### Formula and Input Validation

- [ ] All video bandwidths are calculated using the ASB formula with correct pgroup values from ST 2110-20 tables — not the simplified multiplication formula alone
- [ ] Frame rate is expressed as an exact rational (M/N) — not a decimal approximation (e.g., 60000/1001, not 59.94)[^4]
- [ ] Sampling and depth parameters are confirmed from SDP, not assumed from format name
- [ ] Audio bandwidth includes RTP/UDP/IP overhead per packet, not raw payload only[^6]
- [ ] ST 2110-40 bandwidth is measured or conservatively estimated per ANC payload type — not zero[^30]

### Traffic and Overhead Validation

- [ ] All overhead contributions are accounted for: RTP header (12B) + UDP (8B) + IP (20B) + Ethernet L2 (18B) + L1 (20B)[^7][^6]
- [ ] VLAN tagging (+4 bytes) is included if 802.1Q is active on the link[^28]
- [ ] ST 2022-7 protected flows have their bandwidth doubled in all link budget calculations[^22]
- [ ] Wide (W) sender flows have switch buffer requirements flagged separately from Narrow flows[^8]

### Scope and State Validation

- [ ] Flow state is confirmed: active (IS-05 activated) vs staged vs inactive[^17]
- [ ] Multicast replication factor is accounted for at switch ingress vs egress[^40]
- [ ] Routing transition model is declared (join-before-leave adds double bandwidth during transition)[^41]
- [ ] PTP/management traffic is budgeted separately and not included in essence flow totals

### Assumption and Label Validation

- [ ] Every safety margin percentage is labeled "ASSUMPTION — Engineering Policy, not normative"
- [ ] Every link utilization ceiling is labeled "ASSUMPTION — not normatively defined in ST 2110"
- [ ] Simplified overhead estimates (5–7%) are labeled as vendor-derived, non-normative[^22]
- [ ] ST 2110-40 bandwidth figures are labeled "estimated / unverified" unless measured

## 8. Risk Notes and Ambiguity Areas

### Risk 1: Wide (W) Sender Burst Risk

Wide senders are permitted to exhibit significantly greater burstiness (CMAX = 16, VRXFULL = 720) compared to Narrow senders. A facility with multiple concurrent software-based graphics generators, virtual production systems, or cloud-native senders may have predominantly Wide sources. If switch buffers are sized for Narrow/NL assumptions only, Wide sender bursts can cause packet loss even when average link utilization is below capacity. **Mitigation:** Inventory TP parameter from SDP for all senders; flag all Wide senders; size buffers accordingly.[^20][^8]

### Risk 2: Multicast Replication at Spine-Leaf Boundaries

In spine-leaf topologies, a single inbound multicast stream may be replicated to multiple egress ports at a spine switch. Total egress bandwidth from a spine can exceed the single ingress flow bandwidth by a factor equal to the number of subscribed receivers. Link budgets must model egress traffic, not just ingress.[^37]

### Risk 3: Join-Before-Leave Transition Bandwidth

When IS-05 triggers a routing change with join-before-leave behavior, two active flows coexist briefly on the receiving link — double the expected bandwidth. In a high-density routing environment, simultaneous routing changes can temporarily spike aggregate link bandwidth beyond design capacity. This is **not addressed normatively** in ST 2110 and is an engineering risk that must be managed via routing policy.[^41]

### Risk 4: PTP Grandmaster and Management Traffic Underestimation

PTP (IEEE 1588 / ST 2059) synchronization traffic, IGMP membership reports, IS-04 heartbeats, and IS-05 API traffic all consume link bandwidth. These are typically low per-flow but can accumulate in high-density systems. They are **not included** in ASB calculations and must be budgeted separately or accounted for in safety margins.[^45][^17]

### Risk 5: SDP Parameter Discrepancy

Bandwidth calculations are only as reliable as the SDP parameters they are derived from. If a device reports incorrect SDP metadata (e.g., mismatched exactframerate or incorrect TP value), calculated bandwidth will not match actual wire traffic. Engineering tools should cross-validate calculated bandwidth against live measurement where possible.

### Risk 6: Compressed Video (ST 2110-22) Bandwidth Variability

SMPTE ST 2110-22 defines transport for Constant Bit Rate (CBR) compressed video. If ST 2110-22 flows are present in the monitored system, their bandwidth is codec-dependent and cannot be calculated from the ST 2110-20 ASB formula. This is **implementation-dependent** and requires encoder specification data.[^46]
